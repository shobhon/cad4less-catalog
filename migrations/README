This directory will contain Alembic migration scripts. To initialize
database migrations, run:

```
flask db init
```

Then, after defining or updating your models, create a migration with:

```
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
```

Finally, apply migrations using:

```
flask db upgrade
```

The generated `versions/` subdirectory will contain migration scripts.
